### 👋 Hi there! I'm Antonio, a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience specializing in Backend development. My journey in software engineering began in 2010, and since then, I've honed my skills in crafting robust solutions using Golang and NodeJS (Javascript and Typescript).

### 🚀 Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to applying best practices such as SOLID principles, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and adopting Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture patterns to ensure scalable and maintainable codebases.

### 🗃️ I am proficient with relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB, Redis) databases, leveraging them to build efficient and reliable systems.

### 🌳 As a proactive person, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge base, learning from my peers and staying updated with the latest industry trends. I firmly believe in knowledge sharing and actively contribute to the growth of my team.

### ⚙️ I have extensive experience with Microservices architecture and Event-Driven architecture. I've designed and developed high-traffic microservices, focusing on scalability and reliability, and communicating them through message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS), Redis Streams, as well as synchronous methods like HTTP and gRPC.

### ⚒️ On the infrastructure side, I have experience in setting up CI/CD pipelines, utilizing git, Docker, and Terraform for infrastructure as code. I have a strong grasp of cloud services, particularly AWS, and have designed and implemented highly available and scalable architectures.

### 🤝 Let's connect! I'm always eager to discuss innovative solutions and collaborate on exciting projects.
